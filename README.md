## Much Infos about me
<pre>
PARK4139.about_me='''
    I can use English a little. I know it's not enough, but I'm still trying to use it
    I try to record everything. Because we know that humans are oblivious animals, including me.
    I love dogs!, I live with Yellow Lab[Labrador Retriever]. When things aren't going well, I go for a walk, dogs make me laugh.
    I always search Happiness for me.
    I love watching movie. especially Avartar2 is that i watch recently.
